# bk2-to-fm2
Converts TAS movie files in bk2 format to fm2 format.

## How to use
- Put the bk2 you wanna convert into the same folder as your main.py folder, and rename it to input.bk2
- run `main.py`, and you will see a file named out.fm2 that is the output.

## Disclaimer

I made this thing in half a day, so there are currently many issues.

- It currently only supports 1 player movie.
- Power (Hard reset) is broken.
- Rom Checksum is also broken.
- If there is a random lag frame somewhere in the movie, it will simply break the file. (Somehow normal Super Mario Bros TAS worked)
  
There are lot of things to do with this project, so please let me know about things you think I should change in the code.
